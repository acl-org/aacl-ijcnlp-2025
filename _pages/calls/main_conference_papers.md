**Note: All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 ("anywhere on Earth").**

**Following the [ACL and ARR policies](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy), there is no anonymity period requirement.**

At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., IJCNLP-AACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected IJCNLP-AACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to IJCNLP-AACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than IJCNLP-AACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to IJCNLP-AACL 2025.

## Paper Submission Information

**Note that we are following a new ARR cycle schedule (5 cycles/year)**! Papers may be submitted to the [ARR 2025](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2025/July) July cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 July cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to IJCNLP-AACL 2025 via the [commitment link](#).

## Mandatory Reviewing Workload

ACL adopted a policy similar to CVPR 2025 policy. All authors are expected to sign up to review, with assignments subsequently based on qualifications. The highly irresponsible reviewers may become ineligible from committing their paper(s) to IJCNLP-AACL 2025 or resubmitting in the next cycle. The submitting authors should (a) make sure that all other authors are aware of this policy, and (b) check that everybody on their team(s) submits their (meta-)reviews on time and in accordance with the guidelines. After submission, all authors must complete the author registration form by July 30 2025 EoD AoE. If they get assignments, reviews must be completed by August 27, and meta-reviews - by September 23. In case of any emergencies, the chairs should be warned via the emergency declaration form. More details on the policy here: [https://aclrollingreview.org/incentives2025](https://aclrollingreview.org/incentives2025)

## Additional Policies

Based on feedback regarding increased reviewing load and (relatedly) decreased review quality, we are implementing additional policies to incentivize a lower volume of higher quality submissions and a higher quality of reviews for the IJCNLP-AACL'25 ARR cycle. For details about our reviewer incentives and policies for determining irresponsible reviewers, please see our [Reviewer Policies](https://www.afnlp.org/conferences/ijcnlp2025/reviewer-policies) page.

## IJCNLP-AACL 2025 Theme Track: **Advanced Reasoning and Chain-of-Thought in Language Models**

Explore key aspects of advancing reasoning and chain-of-thought capabilities in language models. We welcome innovative approaches to enhance step-by-step logical deduction, verifiable reasoning, and fact-checking methodologies.

### Summary of Theme Track activities

- **Logical Deduction**. Step-by-step reasoning enhancement
- **Fact-Checking**. Verifiable reasoning systems
- **Cross-Domain**. Interpretable reasoning methods 

## Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to IJCNLP-AACL

IJCNLP-AACL 2025 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net/) platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:

- Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors;
- Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., IJCNLP-AACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

IJCNLP-AACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.

## Paper Submission Details

Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers' comments.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection.
Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
