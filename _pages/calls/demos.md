## Overview

IJCNLP-AACL 2025 invites proposals for system demonstrations showcasing innovative NLP systems, from research prototypes to production-ready solutions. Demonstrations should highlight technological advancements to an international audience of researchers and practitioners. The system demonstrations across all areas of NLP and computational linguistics, which includes (but not limited to)
- *NLP Systems*: Natural language processing systems or system components
- *Application Systems*: Application systems using language technology components
- *Research Tools*: Software tools for natural language processing research
- *Demo & Evaluations*: Software for demonstration or evaluation purposes
- *Educational Tools*: Software supporting learning or education in NLP
- *Data Visualization*: Tools for data visualization and annotation
- *Model Inspection*: Tools for model inspection and analysis
- *Development Tools*: Development tools and frameworks for NLP

In addition, the system demonstrations should exhibit the following characteristics:
- **Open Source Priority**
  - Emphasis is placed on systems that are publicly accessible as open-source or open-access solutions.

- **Industrial Innovation**
  - Showcasing industrial systems that demonstrate technological innovation in NLP applications.

**Best Demo Award**: IJCNLP-AACL 2025 will feature a *Best Demo Award*, which will be evaluated and conferred by a committee member based on their interactions with the demonstrations during the conference.

**Important Note:** Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must include the following:  

**A Paper**

A paper submitted to accompany a demonstration should outline the design of the system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to natural language processing. Technical details of the system are required, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). A paper can do this by addressing the following questions:

- What problem does the proposed system address?
- Why is the system important and what is its impact?
- What is the novelty in the approach/technology on which this system is based?
- Who is the target audience?
- How does the system work?
- How does it compare with existing systems?
- How is the system licensed?
- How was the system evaluated? Were user studies/human evaluation experiments conducted?

Note that submissions that do not report any form of evaluation may be desk rejected.

Submissions can contain up to **6 pages** (longer submissions will be desk rejected), plus **2 pages** for references and informative appendices. Submissions must conform to the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 official style guidelines and must be in PDF format. Submissions must describe original, unpublished work, as publication in IJCNLP-AACL will be archival. Any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines and page limits will be desk rejected.

The template and submission guidelines are available [online](#). Use the provided template and submit through the [START system](#).

**A Demonstration Video**

A short (at most 2.5 minutes) screencast video demonstrating the system together with your paper submission. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won’t be published unless requested. If a screencast is not feasible, a video showcasing user interaction with the system may be used. Simple production is encouraged. Include the link in your paper (YouTube or similar), or submit the video as supplementary material in MPEG4 format.

The content focus of the short screencast video should be on
- **Demonstrating Key Feature**
- **Showing System Workflow**
- **Highlighting Unique Capabilities**
- **Adding in Clear Video Narration**

**Live Demo Website or Installable Package**

A link to a live demo website or a downloadable installation package is required. Submissions without a link will be desk rejected unless justified (e.g., special hardware required).

## Multiple Submission Policy

We follow the Multiple Submission Policy of the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 main conference. Submissions must not be under review or published elsewhere. Authors submitting multiple demo papers must ensure submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) in content or results.

## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing is **single-blind with no rebuttal**. Authors should include names, affiliations, and may cite their own work.

## Ethics Policy

Authors must adhere to the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Research must consider the ethical implications of the system and data used. Extra space is allowed after the 6th page for discussion of broader impacts or ethical considerations. An ethical section is not required, but its absence in sensitive domains may lead to rejection. Papers flagged for ethical issues will be reviewed by the EMNLP ethics committee.
