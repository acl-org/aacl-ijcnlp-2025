## Overview

IJCNLP-AACL 2025 invites the submission of student research workshop papers featuring various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community. We invite papers in two different categories:

- **Thesis Proposals**: This category is appropriate for PhD students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.

- **Research Papers**: Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author MUST BE a current student. Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as for the main IJCNLP-AACL 2025 conference.

Submissions (in both categories) may be archival or non-archival, based on the wish of the authors. All archival papers will be published in the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 SRW Proceedings. Non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except for another SRW. All accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions.

Authors are encouraged to use the additional page to address reviewers’ comments.

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available either as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj) or via [downloading LaTeX or Word files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). We strongly encourage participants to use the LaTeX template. All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files. For anonymity policy, we follow the [ARR anonimity policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/anonymity/). For additional submission instructions, please check the [Author Guidelines](https://aacl2025-srw.github.io/guidelines).

## Paper Submission Details
There are two routes for paper submission:

- **Direct Submission**: Papers should be submitted through [Direct Submission Link](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/SRW). Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. The review process will follow the [ARR review policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policies_for_Review_and_Citation).
- **ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers**: Papers which have already been reviewed through the ARR system can be committed to the SRW. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. ARR papers should be committed through [ARR Commitment Link](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/SRW_ARR_Commitment). When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the OpenReview ID of your paper.

## Pre-Submission Mentorship Program
The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student’s work. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.

Students wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft through [this OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/SRW_Mentorship) by **August 8, 2025**. The paper needs to be **anonymized**. The organizers will check the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.

The participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and provide feedback, which will be given by September 5, 2025. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.

You CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.
